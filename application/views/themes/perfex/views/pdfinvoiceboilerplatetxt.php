Depending on whether you rent, lease or purchase BT, the Licence may be renewable or extendable. For example, the initial BT purchase normally includes a Licence for the first year that you must renew in one year increments by payment of the annual Support Fee, which includes entitlement to Support Services (see below), before the begininng of each succeeding year. Failure to renew or extend means you have neither the Licence or authority to use BT.
            </li>

            <li><b>“Hardware Devices”</b> includes all upstream (to the BTServer) hardware devices specified and/or supplied by CAST that connect to and used by the BTServer.

An Initial Survey may be completed by CAST, a BTE or prospective End User, or in collaboration. A complete Initial Survey includes a 3D CAD of the Space and is used by CAST to ascertain the number and layout of Hardware Devices required to deliver the optimal BTSolution.
            </li>

            <li>Completion of Initial Survey. You are responsible for the complete, reliable and accurate description regarding the intended use of BT and End User’s requirements, as well as for surveying and obtaining the information concering the facility, details regarding the environment in which it will be used, the type of installation (purchase, rent, lease), and timing proposed for installing BT. You are also responsible for all direct and indirect costs incurred with regard thereto.
            </li>

            <li>CAST retains ownership of all information contained in the Initial Survey, including any diagrams, CADs, and electronic files attached as well as any communications concerning the Initial Survey and Preliminary Estimate, all of which is deemed Confidential Information.
            </li>
        </ol>

            <li><b>PE</b> means the form generated and emailed by CAST in response to the Initial Survey. It constitutes a quotation including an estimated price <b>(PE Price)</b> for the supply of a customized BT. For greater certainty, a PE includes any attachments and exhibits, specifications, drawings, notes, instructions and other information, whether physically attached or incorporated by reference, whether or not such information was verbal or nonverbal or was communicated before, at or after the date of the PE. CAST has no obligation to prepare a PE without first receiving a properly completed Initial Survey.
            </li>

            <li>A PE is valid until the <b>PEST Expiry Date</b> stipulated on the PE <b>(Valid Period)</b>. Extensions to the Valid Period are possible but only if granted in writing during the Valid Period by CAST. During this period, you may accept the price or amend the Initial Survey and CAST may issue a new Preliminary Estimate or confirm in writing its previously issued Preliminary Estimate. Such amendments neither extend nor restart the Valid Period.
            </li>

            <li><b>Configuration of BTSystem</b> that meets your needs drives the PE Price.PE Price is net of shipping and taxes. The PE does not include sales or import taxes or any taxes imposed on payments to CAST in its pricing model, so if such taxes are exigible then the amount thereof is strictly for your account.

                <ol type="i">
                    <li>The custom design of the BTSystem, and accordingly the PE Price, that meets your needs comprises a mix of Hardware Devices suitable for the particulars of the Space and foreseeable complexities for occlusion and operational factors, the strategic positions available to mount BTCams, as well as your specifications as per the Initial Survey, to deliver the most utile BTSolution.
                    </li>

                    <li>You acknowledge the PE applicability depends solely on the reliability of Initial Survey provided by you. The configuration of each BTSystem should prioritize the optimal delivery of streaming positional data and robust service and, within reason, not be compromised to achieve a particular price. CAST proposes the BTSystem configuration according to the Initial Survey on the basis that that configuration is best-suited for the Space and prospective End User’s need(s). CAST has no obligation to independently verify, complete an in-field survey, review any technical, design or creative plans, or to confirm the Initial Survey. For example, occlusion between any BTBeacon and BTCams, caused by movement of the trackable or props, may mandate changing the placement or increasing the number of BTCams for better coverage, requiring additional Hardware Devices and increasing the PE Price.
                    </li>

                    <li>You should review the PE carefully as its configuration and layout affect the PE Price. You may at any time make changes to the Initial Survey or by providing written documentation to CAST. In the event that such changes cause a material increase or decrease in the PE configuration and/or PE Price then CAST shall notify you by sending a revised PE.
                    </li>

                    <li>CAST includes Tier 2 Support and backoffice support for Support Services as well as Internet-based Services free of charge for the first-12month period and thereafter bills End Users for extensions or renewals, as the case may be, which amount is payable in advance for ongoing Support Services. Failure to renew or extend means you have neither the Licence or authority to use BT.
